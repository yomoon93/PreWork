        <p id="par">Hello Fellow Peers <br>
            A little about me, my name is Kevin Munar, 
            I was born and raised in Queens, New York. I graduated from New York City 
            Tech with a degree in Computer Engineering. During my free time I work with 
            disabled children. The last child I worked with also had an interest in coding,
             where I would then teach him. There is a saying “if you want to test your knowledge, 
             you teach it.”

    <h2 id="head1">Hobbies</h2>
    <p class="par"> A few hobbies I enjoy be playing video games, 
        working out, playing sports, and of course coding. 
        My most favorite would be playing on my Nintendo Switch, the game 
        I enjoy most would be Animal Crossing.  I have over 600 hours on the game 
        with nothing to show for it, I just like to shake trees, 
        talk to my villagers, and water my plants.  If anyone has Dom in boxes 
        please let me know, 
        I don’t have Nook Mile Tickets to look for him.

    <h2 id="head2">Televison</h2>
    <p class="par">I watch a lot of television on my spare time, some shows 
        I binged watch would be The Office, Black Clover, Naruto, Game of Thrones, 
        Tom and Jerry, a few documentaries and my favorite Schitt’s Creek. I
         started watching it only because they took The Office off Netflix, 
         and it turned out to be an amazing show.  
        “I love that journey for me!”  </p>
